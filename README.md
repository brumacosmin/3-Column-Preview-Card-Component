# 3-Column-Preview-Card-Component

### The challenge

    The challenge was to create a 3 column card component.

### My process

    The project was created using Flexbox instead of Grid as I thought it is more
    suitable in this case.

    This was a fairly simple project, I used mostly resources that I knew previously. However, this was still a good practice for future, more complicated projects

    The project is responsive because I used Flexbox, REM units and also Media Query for mobile where I applied a max-width of 420px.
